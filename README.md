## **Database purpose:**
A startup called Sparkify has an application which provides songs streaming 
capability for the users. The app produce json logs, which contain the 
user activities on the app. The startup wants to understand their users by
analyzing these logs and perform various queries on them easily. 
One of their goals to know what songs are being listened by their users.

## **Database Schema:**
 ![ERD](dwh_erd.png)

 The above image contains the following tables:
 - SONGPLAYS: This table is the main table. It contains song playing 
   transactions generated by the app according to what song has been 
   choosen and played by the user.
   The following are the columns and their description:
   - START_TIME: The timestamp in millisecond for the transaction.
   - USER_ID: The user id for the user who generated this transaction.
     It is a foreign key from the USERS table.
   - LEVEL: The type of the user either free or paid. It holds the 
     level of the user at the timestamp of this transaction.  
   - SONG_ID: The id of the song which has been played by the user.
     It is a foreign key from the SONGS table.
   - ARTIST_ID: The is of the artist for the song played.
     It is a foreign key from ARTISTS table.
   - SESSION_ID: Id for the web session which user was using and resulted
     in generating this transaction.
   - USER_AGENT: text which specify the OS type and version and browser     
     version and type.

- ARTISTS: A table which holds list of artists and any information
  related to them.
  The following are the columns and their description:
  - ARTIST_ID: Unique id for the artist in this table.
  - NAME: Name of the artist.
  - LOCATION: The location of the artist geographically.
  - LATITUDE: The latitude of for the artist location. 
  - LONGITUDE: The longitude of the artist location.

- SONGS: This table holds list of songs and any information related to them.
  The following are the columns and their description:
  - SONG_ID: Unique id for the song in thi table.
  - TITLE: The title of name of the song.
  - ARTIST_ID: The id of the artist of this song.
    It is a foreign key from ARTISTS table.
  - YEAR: The production year of this song. 
  - DURATION: The playing duration of the song.

- TIME: It is a table for all the timestamps appeared in the transactions 
  loaded in the SONGPLAYS table. It contains addition columns
  derived from the timestamp column itself. These can be used to get 
  insights on different levels (hour,day,week,weekday,month,year).
  
- USERS: This table holds all the users who caused in generating any song 
  playing transaction.
  The following are the columns and their description:
  - USER_ID: Unique Id for the user in the table.
  - FIRST_NAME:The first name for the user.
  - LAST_NAME: The last name for the user.
  - GENDER: the gender of the user(M:male,F:female)
  - LEVEL: The type of the user either free or paid. This column holds the
    latest level for the user appeared into the last log file loaded.
 

## **Files and description**
 - **[create_tables.py](/create_tables.py)**: It create the database 'sparkifydb'. Then, it creates
the tables: USERS,SONGPLAYS,SONGS,TIME,ARTISTS and FILES 
 
 - **[sql_queries.py](/sql_queries.py)**: This python script contains all the queries
which are related to creating or dropping the tables mentioned above. It also 
   contains the insert statements which are used in populating these tables.

 - **[etl.py](/etl.py)**: It runs the whole ETL process. It processes all the song files to 
load SONGS,ARTISTS tables. It processes all the log files to load SONGPLAYS,
USERS and TIME tables. After each process it logs some metadata about the file
   which is being loaded in FILES table.
   
 - **[etl.ipynb](/etl.ipynb)**: It is notebook which contains step by step for the 
etl process but on sample file for each process.
   
 - **[test.ipynb](/test.ipynb)**: This notebook can be used to test if the tables
have been populated or not using either [etl.py](/etl.py) or [etl.ipynb](/etl.ipynb)

   

## **Sequence of execution**
 1- Execute create_tables.py to create the database, and the required tables.

 2- Execute etl.py to process the files in data/log_data and data/song_data.
    It will load the tables SONGS,ARTISTS,SONGPLAYS,TIME and USERS. 
    It will also update the table FILES with metadata about the files which are processed.


## **Sample Queries:**
- Getting a trend line for the total usage per hour.
  
  - **Query:** 
    
      SELECT t.hour,count(*) Total FROM songplays p
      INNER JOIN TIME t ON p.start_time=t.START_TIME
      GROUP BY t.hour;
  - **Results:**
  From the graph below the peak hour is 4:00 PM
    ![ERD](peak_hour.png)
    
- Getting the top 10 users who uses the app and their peak hour. This can be used
  to target them by a campaign by sending them promocodes or something like this.
  - **Query:**
  
      SELECT U.USER_ID,U.FIRST_NAME,U.LAST_NAME,X.HOUR Peak_Hour_User
      FROM 
      (
          SELECT X.user_id,Y.hour,ROW_NUMBER()OVER(PARTITION BY Y.USER_ID ORDER BY Y.cnt DESC) R_HOUR
          FROM
          (
              SELECT user_ID,count(*) cnt
              FROM songplays p
              group by user_id
              order by cnt desc
              LIMIT 10
          ) X
          INNER JOIN
          (
              SELECT user_Id,t.hour,count(*) cnt
              FROM songplays p
              INNER JOIN TIME t
              ON p.start_time=t.START_TIME
              group by user_id,t.hour
          )Y
          ON X.user_id = Y.user_Id
      ) X
      INNER JOIN USERS U
      ON U.USER_ID=X.USER_ID
      WHERE R_HOUR=1;

- Getting the count of transactions per gender. Females were the heavy users for the 
  app during that month.
  - **Query:**
    
    SELECT GEnder,count(*) FROM songplays p
    inner join users u
    ON p.user_Id = u.user_Id
    group by gender;
  
- Getting the top 10 artists whom their songs are played by the app users. 
  Because the data is subset, so there is only one row in songplays which contains
  artist_Id and song_Id:
  - **Query:**
    
    SELECT name,count(*)cnt
    FROM songplays p
    inner join ARTISTS a
    on a.artist_Id=p.artist_id
    group by name
    ORDER BY cnt desc
    LIMIT 10;
